Yaml.NET
===========================================================

This project is to create an easy to work with API for reading and
writing YAML documents in .NET languages.  It uses the Irony parsing
framework from http://irony.codeplex.com (I created a git mirror:
git://github.com/stephen-czetty/Irony.git)

## Parsing branch

You are in the parsing branch.  This is where I am working on the
parsing of Yaml with Irony.
